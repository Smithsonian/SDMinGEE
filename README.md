Dr. Crego is a postdoctoral researcher at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (USA). He spatializes in spatial ecology and conservation biology. He uses a combination of field data collection, remote sensing, and advanced modeling to investigate how species adapt to rapid global changes.

Dr. Stabach is an ecologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (USA) and program coordinator of the Smithsonian Institution’s Movement of Life Initiative. His research focuses on the factors that affect the abundance, distribution, and movement patterns of large terrestrial mammals, incorporating remotely sensed- and field data-derived variables to relate to animal point locations to address applied research questions.

Dr. Connette is an ecologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (USA). He specializes in landscape ecology, wildlife population dynamics, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). He currently serves as a science advisor for Smithsonian’s Working Land & Seascapes Initiative, which partners with communities, decision-makers, and other stakeholders to inform environmental conservation policies and practices.
